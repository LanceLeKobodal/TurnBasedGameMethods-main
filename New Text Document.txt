Look at turn based game for inspiration while rewriting code

Premis:
The player character is dropped into an isekai world. They can choose a weapon that they vessel and are locked out of using other weapons like rising of the shield hero.
Can team up with other vessel weapon holders but are locked out of exp gain. Will be forced to team up when a wave comes summoning a storm of monsters invading the world.
The game ends when the waves are over or when all the vessel weapon holders are dead. Will be a high fantasy enviornment. Only when the waves are over can a hero finally drop
their weapons and possibly take the vessel weapons from the other heros

Post game content:
After successfully fighting off the waves and completing story mode the player can invade other worlds collecting forigen rescources and possibly conquer worlds by taking 
their vessel weapons


Todo

Decide on what weapon vessels will be avaliable and what thier playstyles are
-Shield will be tank/buffs/healer all close range
-Sword will be high damage close range
-Spear will be moderate damage with armor piercing and medium range
-Bow will be moderate damage with long distance fighting
-Staff will be strong healer/strong buffs all long range, can die easily
-Tome will be strong magic damage and utility, limited by sp(sp standing for spirit points) usage
-Lance will be calvary combat, summon an evolving steed to traverse the battle field quickly
-Greatsword Heavy hitter use enchantments increase damage heavlily with elemental damage with some resistance using the blade as a shield to parry with
small increase to critical hit chance


Build up skill trees for classes, races, and weapon vessels
-classes and races will be built up by exp
-weapon vessels will have quests tied to them to try and lead back to the main story

Make fire emblem style fighting system

Precraft a story mode to get a hang on how world building works and figure how to generate it stably for world invasions
